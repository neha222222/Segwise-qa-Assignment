# Segwise.ai QA Testing Report

## Executive Summary
This report documents the findings from manual testing of the Segwise.ai dashboard, focusing on identifying bugs, UX inconsistencies, and creating a comprehensive regression testing checklist.

## Testing Environment
- **Application**: Segwise.ai Dashboard
- **Login Credentials**: qa@segwise.ai / segwise_test
- **Browser**: Chrome (via Playwright)
- **Testing Date**: July 8, 2025
- **Tester**: QA Assignment

## Identified Issues and UX Inconsistencies

### 1. **Forced Onboarding Flow - High Priority**
**Issue**: The application redirects users back to the onboarding flow even when attempting to access dashboard URLs directly.
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Login successfully with provided credentials
  2. Navigate to `https://ua.segwise.ai/james_enter/dashboard` or `/reports`
  3. Observe redirect back to onboarding page
- **Expected Behavior**: Users should be able to access dashboard features after login
- **Actual Behavior**: Application forces completion of ad network setup before dashboard access
- **Impact**: Prevents users from exploring dashboard features without connecting external ad networks
- **Severity**: High - Blocks core functionality testing

### 2. **Inconsistent Account Context - Medium Priority**
**Issue**: Login with qa@segwise.ai credentials results in "James_Enter" account context
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Login with qa@segwise.ai
  2. Observe account name shows as "James_Enter" in UI
- **Expected Behavior**: Account context should match login credentials or be clearly explained
- **Actual Behavior**: Confusing account identity mismatch
- **Impact**: User confusion about account context
- **Severity**: Medium - UX inconsistency

### 3. **Disabled Next Button Without Clear Feedback - Medium Priority**
**Issue**: The "Next" button in onboarding remains disabled without clear indication of requirements
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Reach the "Connect Adnetwork" onboarding step
  2. Observe disabled "Next" button
  3. No clear visual indication of what action is required
- **Expected Behavior**: Clear visual cues or tooltip explaining why button is disabled
- **Actual Behavior**: Button appears disabled with no guidance
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, unclear next steps
- **Severity**: Medium - UX issue

### 4. **Modal Interaction Issues - Low Priority**
**Issue**: Ad network configuration modals may have clickability issues with close buttons
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Click on Meta ad network option
  2. Attempt to close modal using X button
  3. May experience timeout errors
- **Expected Behavior**: Modal should close reliably
- **Actual Behavior**: Intermittent timeout issues with modal interactions
- **Impact**: Minor interaction friction
- **Severity**: Low - Intermittent issue

### 5. **Loading State Persistence - Medium Priority**
**Issue**: Dashboard pages show loading states that persist and redirect back to onboarding
- **Steps to Reproduce**: 
  1. Navigate to dashboard URLs directly
  2. Observe loading dots
  3. Page redirects back to onboarding instead of loading content
- **Expected Behavior**: Either load dashboard content or show clear error message
- **Actual Behavior**: Misleading loading state followed by redirect
- **Impact**: Confusing user experience
- **Severity**: Medium - UX inconsistency

## Positive Observations

### 1. **Responsive Chat Support**
- Chat support widget is easily accessible and responsive
- Good UX pattern for user assistance

### 2. **Clear Onboarding Progress Indicators**
- Step-by-step progress visualization is clear and helpful
- Good visual hierarchy in onboarding flow

### 3. **Comprehensive Ad Network Options**
- Wide variety of ad network integrations available
- Clear categorization with "Popular" and "Beta" labels

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Provide Demo/Test Mode**: Allow QA users to access dashboard features without requiring real ad network connections
2. **Improve Button State Feedback**: Add tooltips or help text explaining why buttons are disabled
3. **Fix Account Context**: Ensure login credentials match displayed account information
4. **Enhance Error Handling**: Replace misleading loading states with clear error messages or alternative paths

### Long-term Improvements
1. **Progressive Onboarding**: Allow partial dashboard access before full setup completion
2. **Better Modal UX**: Improve modal interaction reliability and accessibility
3. **Skip Options**: Provide "Skip for now" or "Demo mode" options for evaluation users

## Testing Limitations

Due to the forced onboarding flow, comprehensive testing of the following features was not possible:
- Filters & Boards functionality
- Custom reports features
- Dashboard charts and metrics
- Data visualization components

**Note**: The assignment mentioned product videos for understanding Filters & Boards and Custom reports features, but these were not accessible during testing.

## Next Steps

1. request access to demo/test mode or sample data for comprehensive dashboard testing
2. Obtain product videos mentioned in assignment for better feature understanding
3. Complete automation script testing with available functionality
4. expand regression checklist once full dashboard access is available
